# Migration Advisor Data location

This is the folder where the migration advisor stores its configuration documents (mostly transform files for the [Refactor module](https://github.com/FriedrichWeinmann/Refactor)).
However, this is only the location where these files are placed after build automation has run its course!

If you are looking to contribute to the project, look into the [`data` folder in the source folder of the repository](https://github.com/FriedrichWeinmann/PSAzureMigrationAdvisor/tree/master/build) - that's where all the input comes from that gets built into the released module.
